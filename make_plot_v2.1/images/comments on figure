Comments on figure for CB builder paper 

We are going to make it be full page and to help seeing everything can you break everything out into individual plots? And drop the beta ones that are only 3 points.
With everything in separate plots you can use black and white, and see what it looks like if you keep the same scale on the frequency plots.

Figure 4 - This figure should undergo some alterations to ensure it is accurate and accessible. The colour scheme used may cause difficulty to some colour-blind readers, it would be helpful to use alternate plot markers to differentiate between the varying linkages. Additionally, the y axis label is missing on the left plot, and there are no units on the plot. While it is understandable that the authors chose to use different scales for the beta and alpha plots, their proximity may suggest to a non-cautious reader that the frequency distributions are the same."
I think we could make it into a large multi-panel figure rather than trying to fit everything into two plots.
